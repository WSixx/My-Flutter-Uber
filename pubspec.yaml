  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/car_android.png
     - assets/images/car_ios.png
     - assets/images/desticon.png
     - assets/images/desticon1.png
     - assets/images/logo.png
     - assets/images/logo1.png
     - assets/images/pickicon.png
     - assets/images/posimarker.png
     - assets/images/redmarker.png
     - assets/images/taxi.png
     - assets/images/user_icon.png
     - assets/sounds

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Signatra
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Signatra.ttf

    - family: Brand-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/bolt-regular.ttf

    - family: Brand Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/bolt-semibold.ttf
